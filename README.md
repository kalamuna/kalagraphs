# Kalagraphs (Kalamuna Paragraphs)

Kalagraphs aims to empower front-end developers with the tools to maintain a warchest of components available to Drupal editors. It accomplishes this by making components cheap and easy to create and manage. No longer must you have badass [PHP](http://php.net/) developer skills with intimate knowledge of [Features module](https://www.drupal.org/project/features) voodoo just to get your components on a CMS page. Let the component names be specific and let the markup do its thing, all without needing to create an unmanagable number of Paragraph types!

In practice, Kalagraphs facilitates rapid development of components from a styleguide (e.g., [kalastatic](https://github.com/kalamuna/kalastatic), [kss](http://warpspire.com/kss/), or [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/)) to implementation ([Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) via [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)).

## Benefits

1.  Decrease the development time and effort required to "CMSify" new components (make them available in Drupal) by removing the need for creation of new Paragraph types.

1.  Improve the editorial UX by decluttering the edit form (fewer Paragraph types) and adding logos/icons to help editors identify each type (planned).

1.  Make it possible to switch between component types without data loss / having to re-input the field data.
